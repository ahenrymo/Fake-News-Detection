# Fake News Detection using NLP

This project is dedicated to detecting fake news using Natural Language Processing (NLP) techniques. It explores and implements various machine learning algorithms to distinguish between real and fake news.

## Overview

The notebook `fake-news-detection.ipynb` provides a detailed exploration of the methods used for fake news detection. The focus is primarily on two machine learning algorithms: Naive Bayes and Passive Aggressive Classifier Algorithm.

## Getting Started

To run and explore this project:

1. Clone the repository.
2. Install the necessary dependencies.
3. Open the Jupyter notebook: jupyter notebook fake-news-detection.ipynb

## Key Sections

- **Naive Bayes**: This section involves the implementation of the Naive Bayes classifier, a popular algorithm for classification problems.
- **Passive Aggressive Classifier Algorithm**: Exploration and application of the Passive Aggressive Classifier for fake news detection.

## Installation

Dependencies required for this project can be installed using:pip install -r requirements.txt

## Dataset

The dataset used in this project consists of real and fake news articles

## Results

The notebook presents a comparative analysis of the Naive Bayes and Passive Aggressive Classifier algorithms based on their performance in detecting fake news.
